# Transit Oriented Development: Accessibility & Health Vulnerability

**Authors** Gregory Harasym

## Problem Statement
I will be exploring the potential long-term health impacts of transit-oriented development being situated adjacent to freeways in the Bay Area. TOD is a means to increase density and reduce our carbon-footprint through the encouragement away from auto-centric mobility and towards public transit. Due to the nature of BART being directly parallel to a large portion of highway infrastructure, a portion of TOD projects in the Bay will essentially be subsidizing market rate and low-income people to live adjecent to freeways, which have higher concentrations of particulate matter exposure and can lead to asthma and other respiratory complications.

Specifically, I will be concentrating on the distribution of PM2.5 data in the Bay Area. Research has shown that short-term exposures (up to 24-hours duration) of PM2.5 have been associated with premature mortality, increased hospital admissions for heart or lung causes, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, emergency room visits, respiratory symptoms, and restricted activity days. This will pollutant will be the primary evaluating factor I will be focusing on to determine the ideal eucledian distance for TOD's from freeway adjacent BART stations.

## Bay Area Pollution PM2.5 Concentration

From the figure below, it appears that Oakland has the highest concentration of PM2.5 in the Bay Area. This Figure is included to show the ways in which data can be manpiluated if not normalized. Areas in the South Bay appear to have the lowest levels of concentration of PM2.5.
