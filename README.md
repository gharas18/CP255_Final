# Transit Oriented Development: Accessibility & Health Vulnerability

## Problem Statement
I will be exploring the potential long-term health impacts of transit-oriented development being situated adjacent to freeways in the Bay Area. TOD is a means to increase density and reduce our carbon-footprint through the encouragement away from auto-centric mobility and towards public transit. Due to the nature of BART being directly parallel to a large portion of highway infrastructure, a portion of TOD projects in the Bay will essentially be subsidizing market rate and low-income people to live adjecent to freeways, which have higher concentrations of particulate matter exposure and can lead to asthma and other respiratory complications.

## Bay Area Pollution PM2.5 Concentration

From the figure below, it appears that Oakland has the highest concentration of PM2.5 in the 9 county Bay Area. This Figure is included to show the ways in which data can be manpiluated if not normalized.
